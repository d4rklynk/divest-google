## Glossary<a name="glossary"></a>
  - Front-end alternative : a website or application that proxies the original service to provide more privacy. (example : NewPipe on Android is used to watch videos from Youtube, but it isn't an offical application of Google/Youtube)
  - Free (as in speech) : you can use the software as you like, run it as you like, improve the program and redistribute the software if you want to.
  - Free (as in beer) : there's no cost
  - Open-Source : the code is open, anyone can read it.
  - FOSS : acronym for Free, Open-Source Software
