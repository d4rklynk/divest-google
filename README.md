## What is this list ?<a name="what"></a>
This guide is meant to be used for those who want to remove their google account. Did you ever wonder : What am I losing if I remove my Google account ? Well, this page is for you.
For example: Don't forget your passwords on chrome or don't forget your contact synchronisation with Google Contacts.
It worth notice that this guide is only here to help you deleting your google account, you can still use Google Maps, Google Contact (but without synchronization) and Google Messages for instance.

## Glossary<a name="glossary"></a>
  - Front-end alternative : the client you use is different from the official one, but it still takes the data from the official servers of the application (example : NewPipe on Android is used to see videos from Youtube, but it isn't an offical application of Google/Youtube)
  - Free (as in speech) : means there is a philosophy behind the software, you can use the software as you like, run as you like, you can improve the program, and you can redistribute the software if you want to.
  - Free (as in beer) : means just that there's no cost
  - Open-Source : means that the code is open, everyone can read it.
  - FOSS : is the abbreviation of Free, Open-Source Software
